Hi [Client Name],

Thanks so much for reaching out!

I've received your message and will review the details you've shared. This initial phase is all about making sure I'm the right fit for your project's goals.

To help me get a better understanding of your needs, could you please provide a bit more information on the following?

*   **Primary Goal:** What is the single most important outcome you're looking for?
*   **Timeline:** Do you have a specific deadline or launch date in mind?
*   **Budget:** Do you have a budget range allocated for this project? (This helps me scope my recommendations accordingly).

Once I have these details, I can determine the next best steps. If it looks like a good fit, I typically suggest a brief 15-20 minute discovery call to dive deeper.

Looking forward to learning more about your project.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
