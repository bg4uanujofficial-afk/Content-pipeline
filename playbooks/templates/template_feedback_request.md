Subject: A Quick Question About Your Experience with [Project Name]

Hi [Client Name],

I hope you're doing well and are happy with the results of our recent project, **[Project Name]**.

I'm always looking to improve my process and services, and your feedback would be incredibly valuable. If you have a moment, could you share your thoughts on your experience working with me?

Also, testimonials are a huge help for a freelancer like me. If you were happy with the outcome, would you be open to writing a brief testimonial that I could feature on my website/portfolio?

A sentence or two is more than enough. You could consider answering one of these questions:
*   What was the best part of our collaboration?
*   How did this project help you achieve your goals?

No pressure at all, of course.

Thanks again for the wonderful collaboration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
