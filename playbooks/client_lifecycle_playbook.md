This document outlines the end-to-end process for managing a client project, from initial contact to post-project follow-up. It serves as the central operational guide for this freelance business.

## Phase 1: Lead & Qualification

The goal of this phase is to capture new leads, determine if they are a good fit, and provide a clear and professional first impression.

*   **Step 1: Lead Capture**
    *   **Action:** A potential client reaches out (e.g., via email, contact form, social media).
    *   **System:** All leads are funneled into a central inbox.

*   **Step 2: Initial Response & Qualification**
    *   **Action:** Send a prompt reply acknowledging receipt of their message.
    *   **System:** Use `template_initial_response.md`.
    *   **Action:** Ask clarifying questions to understand their needs, budget, and timeline. The goal is to "qualify" them—are they a serious client and a good fit for your services?

*   **Step 3: Initial Consultation**
    *   **Action:** If qualified, schedule a brief discovery call (15-30 minutes).
    *   **System:** Use a scheduling tool (e.g., Calendly) to avoid back-and-forth.
    *   **Goal:** Understand the project's core requirements and build rapport.

## Phase 2: Proposal & Agreement

The goal of this phase is to define the project scope, timeline, and cost, and secure a formal agreement.

*   **Step 1: Draft Proposal**
    *   **Action:** Based on the consultation, create a detailed project proposal.
    *   **System:** Use `template_project_proposal.md`. The proposal must include:
        *   Project Goals & Deliverables
        *   Scope of Work
        *   Timeline & Milestones
        *   Cost & Payment Terms
        *   Your Terms of Service

*   **Step 2: Send Proposal & Negotiate**
    *   **Action:** Send the proposal to the client for review. Be prepared to answer questions or make adjustments.

*   **Step 3: Sign Contract & Initial Invoice**
    *   **Action:** Once the proposal is accepted, formalize it with a contract or statement of work.
    *   **System:** Use a digital signature service (e.g., DocuSign, PandaDoc).
    *   **Action:** Send the invoice for the initial deposit (e.g., 50%).
    *   **System:** Use `template_invoice.md` and an invoicing tool. Project work does not begin until the contract is signed and the deposit is paid.

## Phase 3: Project Execution & Delivery

The goal of this phase is to complete the work to a high standard, communicate effectively, and deliver on time.

*   **Step 1: Client Onboarding**
    *   **Action:** Officially welcome the client. Create a dedicated project folder.
    **System:** Use `create_new_project.ps1` to scaffold the project directory inside `/projects`.
    *   **Action:** Gather all necessary assets, logins, and information from the client.

*   **Step 2: Regular Updates**
    *   **Action:** Provide regular, proactive updates (e.g., weekly summary email). This builds trust and avoids client anxiety.

*   **Step 3: Milestone Delivery & Revisions**
    *   **Action:** Deliver work at agreed-upon milestones.
    *   **Action:** Manage client feedback and complete revisions as defined in the contract.

*   **Step 4: Final Delivery**
    *   **Action:** Deliver the completed project files to the client.
    *   **System:** Use `template_final_delivery.md` for the delivery email.

## Phase 4: Invoicing & Offboarding

The goal of this phase is to ensure final payment is received and the project is formally closed.

*   **Step 1: Final Invoice**
    *   **Action:** Send the final invoice for the remaining balance.
    *   **System:** Use `template_invoice.md`.

*   **Step 2: Project Archive**
    *   **Action:** Once paid, archive all project files in a designated "Completed" area.

## Phase 5: Post-Project & Follow-up

The goal of this phase is to gather feedback for improvement and nurture a long-term relationship.

*   **Step 1: Request Feedback/Testimonial**
    *   **Action:** A week after project completion, send a polite request for feedback or a testimonial.
    *   **System:** Use `template_feedback_request.md`.

*   **Step 2: Long-Term Nurturing**
    *   **Action:** Add the client to a low-frequency mailing list or check in with them quarterly to stay top-of-mind for future work.
